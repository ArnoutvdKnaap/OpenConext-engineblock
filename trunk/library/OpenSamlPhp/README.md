OpenSamlPhp
===========

The OpenSamlPhp library aims to provide a comprehensive PHP > 5.3 library
with which to develop SAML2 clients, servers and proxies.

It's guiding philosophy is to serve as a solid basis for SAML2 implementations
and to do so delivering the following (in this order):
* Compliance
* Extensibility
* Ease of use
* Tolerance of input
* Performance

NOTE: this is unfinished POC code, largely meant to display how it COULD work
