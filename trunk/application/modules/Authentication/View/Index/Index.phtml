            Metadata for Shibboleth Service Providers, to configure EngineBlock as your Identity Provider. If an
            alternative Engineblock signing certificate is configured for a certain SP it will be shown in the metadata.
            <strong>NB. This is only important for SP's that rely on the Engineblock metadata URL for refreshing metadata. For SP's
            that configure metadata oob this is not relevant.</strong>

            Metadata for Identity Providers, to add EngineBlock as registered Service Provider.

            <br />
            Metadata with ALL known EngineBlock providers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/authentication/proxy/idps-metadata?sp-entity-id=https%3A%2F%2Fmysp.com%2FassertionConsume">

            </a>
            <br />
            For Shibboleth Service Providers, get ALL known EngineBlock providers AND (if known)
            give the metadata for Service Provider with the endpoint:
            'https://mysp.com/assertionConsume'
            (Shibboleth expects to see it's self in the metadata document).
            Also if an alternative signing certificate is configured in Engineblock the new public key will be shown
            in the metadata.
        </li>
