Note to future programmers, because translation was not determined a 'big part of EngineBlock', the Array adapter
was chosen.
This is not a performant (memory wise) adapter and it doesn't scale to thousands of translations.

So should this requirement change (in which case the the files in this directory will fill up rapidly)
the switch to something like TMX would be required.
